# ðŸŽµ Metasong - Audio Metadata Extractor

This Python script extracts metadata and lyrics from audio files in an album folder (MP3 format) and saves them to JSON files. It utilizes multiprocessing for parallel processing, making it efficient for handling a large number of audio files.

## Features

- Extracts metadata such as track number, title, authors, album, year, duration, artwork description, and sentiment analysis. (Powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo API and GPT-4 Vision API.)
- Retrieves lyrics from audio files using the Genius API.
- Utilizes multiprocessing to process audio files in parallel, improving performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- External dependencies (check requirements.txt for details)
- OpenAI API key (GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 Vision a.k.a. you need to pay for this service.)
- Genius API access token

## Installation
